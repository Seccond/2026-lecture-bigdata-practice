"""Week 6 · Task 1 — A-Priori, and why the second pass is the whole problem.

Textbook §6.1 (market-basket model), §6.2 (A-Priori).

Finding frequent pairs is easy until you count how many pairs there are. With
n items there are n(n-1)/2 of them, and for a supermarket's 10,000 items that
is 50 million counters before you have read a single basket.

A-Priori's observation is one sentence long: **a pair cannot be frequent unless
both of its items are frequent.** One extra pass over the data buys you a much
smaller second pass, and the whole chapter is consequences of that trade.
