"""Week 3 · Task 1 — Minhash and LSH, built from the matrix up.

Textbook §3.2 - §3.4.

Comparing every pair is quadratic, so it stops being possible somewhere around
a hundred thousand documents. The way out is two ideas stacked:

    minhash   replace a set with a short signature, such that the chance two
              signatures agree in a position equals their Jaccard similarity
    LSH       hash bands of those signatures so that similar pairs collide and
              you only ever compare the ones that did

You build both. The textbook's §3.3.5 example is small enough to check by hand,
and the harness checks you against it.

    of every column that has a 1 in it:

    Doing it that way is the point. If you sort or re-scan per column you have
    written something correct that does not survive a dataset that does not fit
    in memory, and not fitting in memory is what this course is about.

    So: rows are consumed in one forward pass and never revisited. The only

    len(columns) x len(hashes) - independent of how many rows there are.
