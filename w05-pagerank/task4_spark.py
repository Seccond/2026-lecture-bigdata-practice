"""Week 5 · Task 4 (optional) — PageRank until one machine is not enough.

Textbook §5.2, and §2.3 for why iterative jobs look the way they do in MapReduce.

Task 3 made PageRank sparse, and sparse is enough for a very long time. This task
finds where "a very long time" ends on your machine, and checks whether the thing
that was slower at small scale is still running when yours has stopped.

    python3 task4_spark.py --nodes 50000            # your task 3 version
    python3 task4_spark.py --nodes 50000 --spark    # and Spark, side by side
    python3 task4_spark.py --nodes 2000000 --spark  # keep going

Optional. Not part of the assignment.
