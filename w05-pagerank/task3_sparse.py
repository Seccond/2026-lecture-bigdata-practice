"""Week 5 · Task 3 — PageRank on a graph that will not fit as a matrix.

Textbook §5.2 (efficient PageRank), §5.2.1 - §5.2.3.

`DenseMatrix` is PageRank written the way the equations are written: build the
transition matrix M, multiply. It is correct, it is easy to read, and it stores
n^2 numbers for a graph with almost no edges.

The web's matrix is about 99.9999% zeros. Storing them is the problem, and
§5.2 is the chapter about not doing that.

    python3 bench.py
    python3 bench.py --yours

Correctness first: the harness compares your ranks against the dense version
element by element. A fast PageRank that ranks pages differently is a different
algorithm, not a faster one.

    Same ranks, to within 1e-9 per node. Far less memory.

    `graph` is {node: [out-neighbours]}. Note what that already is: an adjacency
    list, which is the sparse representation. The dense version throws that
    structure away and then pays to get it back.

    Two things to be careful about, and they are the same two as Task 1:

      * dead ends, whose rank has to go somewhere
      * the teleport term, which touches every node and is therefore the one
        part that looks like it needs a dense operation - it does not, and
        working out why is the point of §5.2.3

    `memory_floats()` is on your honour and the harness reads it. Count the
    numbers you actually hold at once.
